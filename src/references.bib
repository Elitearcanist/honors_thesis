	abstract = {Context and location services become increasingly important in many Internet of Things ({IoT}) applications such as smart home, disaster assistance, security and safety in smart factory and so on. Traditionally, these services are provided by independent systems. In this paper, we propose a software defined radio ({SDR}) based multi-function radar for respiratory rate and moving speed detections as well as ranging, which can be used to provide human body detection and tracking in human-centric {IoT} applications. Since {SDR} concept is adopted, the same hardware platform could be shared with wireless communications periodically by re-defining. The system architecture design is introduced. The detection algorithms are presented. The ranging performance is compared with some typical ones using simulations. The detections for respiratory rate, ranging and moving speed are carried out on the {SDR} platform consisting of {FMCOMMS}5 and {ZC}706. The system occupies 2MHz bandwidth. It is shown that the proposed multi-function radar achieves the estimation of the human respiratory rate with {\textless};5\% errors compared to a clinic-grade device. The ranging resolution achieved is {\textless};0.3 m. The tiny movement as slow as 0.19 m/s can be detected.},

	abstract = {Abstract Software defined radar ({SDRadar}) systems have become an important area for future radar development and are based on similar concepts to Software defined radio ({SDR}). Most of the processing like filtering, frequency conversion and signal generation are implemented in software. Currently, radar systems tend to have complex signal processing and operate at wider bandwidth, which means that limits on the available computational power must be considered when designing a {SDRadar} system. This paper presents a feasible solution to this potential limitation by accelerating the signal processing using a {GPU} to enable the development of a high speed {SDRadar} system. The developed system overcomes the limitation on the processing speed by {CPU}-only, and has been tested on three different {SDR} devices. Results show that, with {GPU} accelerator, the processing rate can achieve up to 80 {MHz} compared to 20 {MHz} with the {CPU}-only. The high speed processing makes it possible to run in real-time and process full bandwidth across the {WiFi} signal acquired by multiple channels. The gains made through porting the processing to the {GPU} moves the technology towards real-world application in various scenarios ranging from healthcare to {IoT}, and other applications that required significant computational processing.},

	abstract = {The {NATO} {SPS} G-5014 project has shown the possibility of using a holographic {RADAR} for the detection of anti-personnel mines. To use the {RADAR} on a robotic scanning system, it must be portable, light, easily integrated with mechanical handling systems and configurable in its operating parameters for optimal performance on different terrains. The novel contribution is to use software programmable electronics to optimize performance and to use a time reference to obtain synchronization between the {RADAR} samples and the position in space, in order to make it easy to integrate the {RADAR} on robotic platforms. To achieve these goals we used the Analog Devices “{ADALM} Pluto” device based on Software Defined Radio technology and a time server. We have obtained a portable system, configurable via software in all its operating parameters and easily integrated on robotic scanning platforms. The paper will show experiments performed on a simulated minefield. The electronics project reported in this work makes holographic {RADARs} portable and easily reconfigurable, therefore adaptable to different applications from subsurface soil investigations to applications in the field of non-destructive testings.},

Traditionally, ice-penetrating radars have not been widely accessible to the glaciological community (as in the case of resource-intensive airborne systems) and/or have been limited in their ability to be reconfigured and optimized for studying different glaciological targets (as in the case of hardware-defined radar systems). To alleviate the challenges associated with this situation, we have developed the Open Radar Code Architecture ({ORCA}), which is an open-source radar software codebase that allows commercially available software-defined radios ({SDRs}) to be used as coherent ice-penetrating radars. Here, we describe the architecture of our code, characterize coherence on {SDR}-based radars, and demonstrate techniques we use to improve {SNR} and overall performance. We also highlight the variety of {SDR} options available to potential users and discuss tradeoffs between different system configurations.},
