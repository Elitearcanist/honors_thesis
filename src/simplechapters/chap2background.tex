Radar is a basic application of radio communication.
In a traditional radio system a transmitter emits electromagnetic waves which can then be detected by a receiving device.
The receiving device can be quite distant from the transmitter allowing wireless communication across vast spaces. % unnecessary sentance
A radar system works by plcaing the transmitter and receiver a known distance apart, often very close for simplicity.
The transmitter then sends a known signal, the receiver, rather than solely attempting to detect the main transmission,
detects the reflections of that signal off of physical objects in the signals path.
By using precise timing and some simple math, the distance from the receiver can be calculated.

The system implemented in this paper is a subset of radar called a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar.
