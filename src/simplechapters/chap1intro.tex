% Paragraph about SDR radar research
Software-defined radios have had a significant increase in usage in radar applications in the last decade. % TODO cite reviewing SDR in radar
The increase in radar research using SDRs has come from the improvement in SDR capabilities.
Feng, Mughees and Wollesen's review of SDRs in radar systems is an effective summary of SDR radar research from 2010 to 2020.
My introductory review will focus on more recent publications in SDR Radar research.

More recent radar research with SDRs has seen improvements in processing through GPU acceleration. % TODO cite GPU paper
Another paper used a low end SDR, the "Adalm-PLUTO" to detect landmines for use in robotic landmine removal systems. % TODO cite Bossi



% BYUs prior work in SDR radar and avalanche detection
Avalanche detection systems have also been researched at BYU for several years. One paper % TODO
